## Unsupervised Learning - Identify Customers Segments

### Project Overview
In this project, I work with real-life data provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I also assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

### Data
There are four files associated with the data of this project:
- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.

I completed this project as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.
